Year 2144...

Life on Earth is coming to an end. 
Humanity's last hope is to colonize Mars. 
But,
It won't be easy.

Humans will not be alone on the Red Planet. 
There are unidentified hostile signals coming from the Mars planetary surface. 
Humanity needs to secure a place to start sending colony ships. 

Humanity United Nations (HUN) organization recently selected Turkey for this suicide mission. 
Altay, the most sophisticated war-machine ever, has to investigate hostile incomings, seek them and destroy them to secure this planet of "hope". 

It is time to be a hero not only for...
a country, 
a planet, 
but all of us, the human species. 

And pilot!

You are selected for this most honorable mission. 

Good luck and make us proud!
